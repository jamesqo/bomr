Is your text editor polluting your precious code with UTF-8 BOMs? bomr is here to help.

## Usage

```bash
bomr <files>
```

### I want to do this for all files in &lt;dir&gt;.

```bash
bomr -r <dir>
```

#### Except for files whose full name matches &lt;regex&gt;.

```bash
bomr -r <dir> -e "<regex>" # note the quotes
```

## Supported Platforms

Any system that supports Bash should be good to go, including:

- Linux
- OS X
- Git Bash (aka MinGW)
- Cygwin
